# Welcome to your VS Code Extension

## What's in the folder

- This folder contains all of the files necessary for your extension.
- `package.json` - this is the manifest file in which you declare your language support and define the location of the grammar file that has been copied into your extension. you declare your extension and command.
  - The sample plugin registers a command and defines its title and command name. With this information VS Code can show the command in the command palette. It doesn’t yet need to load the plugin.
- `syntaxes/aiken.tmLanguage.json` - this is the Text mate grammar file that is used for tokenization.
- `language-configuration.json` - this is the language configuration, defining the tokens that are used for comments and brackets.
- `src/extension.ts` - this is the main file where you will provide the implementation of your command.
  - The file exports one function, `activate`, which is called the very first time your extension is activated (in this case by executing the command). Inside the `activate` function we call `registerCommand`.
  - We pass the function containing the implementation of the command as the second parameter to `registerCommand`.

## Get up and running straight away

- Make sure the language configuration settings in `language-configuration.json` are accurate.
- Press `F5` to open a new window with your extension loaded.
- Create a new file with a file name suffix matching your language.
- Verify that syntax highlighting works and that the language configuration settings are working.

## Make changes

- You can relaunch the extension from the debug toolbar after making changes to the files listed above.
- - You can relaunch the extension from the debug toolbar after changing code in `src/extension.ts`.
- You can also reload (`Ctrl+R` or `Cmd+R` on Mac) the VS Code window with your extension to load your changes.

## Add more language features

- Make changes to `src/test/suite/extension.test.ts` or create new test files inside the `test/suite` folder.
  - The provided test runner will only consider files matching the name pattern `**.test.ts`.
  - You can create folders inside the `test` folder to structure your tests any way you want.
